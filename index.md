This curriculum from the [BASIL biochemistry consortium]({{ site.basil_site }}) (Biochemistry Authentic Scientific Inquiry Laboratory) aims to develop students' skills in protein biochemistry and maturation as scientists.  Students will analyze proteins of unknown function using wet-lab bench techniques as well as computational analysis.  Further details about BASIL can be found on the [BASIL blog](basiliuse.blogspot.com). While applicable at more introductory levels, BASIL is targeted to students in upper-level years of a biology, biochemistry, or chemistry major.

These lessons are typically used as part of biochemistry laboratory coursework, typically an upper-level undergraduate course with at least one semester of biochemistry as a pre-requisite or co-requisite. The class may be part of a required sequence of study for biochemistry majors and often draws students from various science majors. Participants are typically juniors or seniors. The lab has been designed for classes ranging from 10-24 students (working in teams of two or three) per lab section, with one faculty member and one undergraduate teaching assistant.  This lesson could be adapted to laboratory courses for introductory biology, cell and molecular biology, or advanced biology labs.
